    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Amber Davis and I'm currently studying on campus in Rexburg, Idaho. I'm originally from
        Wyoming where I've lived my whole life until college. I recently got married last April in the Provo City Center
        Temple to my
        husband, Mike. He is my best friend!
    </p>

    <p>I'm studying web design and development, emphasizing more in design. I love anything creative, such as graphic
        design, photography,
        and of course web design. I find it to be very enjoyable to make something out of nothing! In the future, I hope
        to own my own photography
        and design business, and work alongside with my husband, who is also studying web development.
    </p>
