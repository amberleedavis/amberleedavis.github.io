        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of my website is to educate people on white water rafting,as well as advertise my services. 
            Other content that will be added to my website are safety rules that should be implemented while rafting.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> My audience will typically be for adults 18-30, and in college, or with a small family. This audience will help me
            target the right people because they are usually the ones who come in for rafting.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Lora</h4>
        <p>I chose Lora as my heading font because it is a nice contrast to my paragraph font. Since it's a serif, it will
            compliment the sans serif I have chosen for the body copy. I also chose this font because it's simple and
            easy to read.
        </p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Raleway</h4>
        <p>Raleway is one of my favorite fonts to use for body copy. It's simple and very easy to read. It also is very modern,
            which is a look I like to go for.
        </p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
            experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company
            can make it happen for you.</p>
