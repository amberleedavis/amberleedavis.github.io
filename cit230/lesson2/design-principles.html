        <h1>PARC: Alignment</h1>
        <h2>Amazon</h2>

        <p class="more">
        <a class="button" href="https://www.amazon.com">Go to Amazon</a>
        </p>

        <p>Alignment is very prominent on Amazon's website. Looking at their home page, you can see that everything lines up
            perfectly with each other. For example, the yellow "Sign in" button is perfectly in align with the "Create an account"
            button directly underneath it. Alignment helps with the consistency of a page, and makes it more aesthetically pleasing.

        <h1>PARC: Repetition</h1>
        <h2>Pinterest</h2>

        <p class="more">
        <a class="button" href="https://www.pinterest.com">Go to Pinterest</a>
        </p>

        <img class="center" src="images/Pinterest1.png" alt="mobile screenshot of Pinterest's website">
        <p>Repetition helps bring balance to any website. Looking at Pinterest's website, repetition is very obvious. The only
            content on this website is a bunch of pictures, sometimes linked to other websites. You can see the repetition on the
            size of each photo; I've noticed that there are consistently two sizes of photos used on Pinterest. This helps the 
            website not look so scattered or messy.</p>

        <h1>PARC: Contrast</h1>
        <h2>National Geographic</h2>

        <p class="more">
        <a class="button"  href="www.nationalgeographic.com"> Go to National Geographic</a>
        </p>

        <img class="center" src="images/Natgeo1.png" alt="mobile screenshot of National Geographic's website">
        <p>Contrast is, and should be, used throughout any website. This is what helps viewers read text and notice important
            details. on National Geographic's website, you can see that the black text on white backgrounds, or vice versa, make
            the words stand out more. There are also other details, such as the yellow button at the top on the black background.
