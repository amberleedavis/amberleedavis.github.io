                <h1>Description</h1>
                The target audience for this website are photographers who
                are trying to find good predictions of when the best time would be 
                to shoot. A lot of this is based on weather conditions and how much
                light is outside. This will be a planning tool so they can be at the right
                place at the right time to get that perfect shot.
